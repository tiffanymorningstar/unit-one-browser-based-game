When he failed to sell enough to pay back the con man, he was brought to court.

An assistant to the council meets you inside and brings you to where the council convenes in the basement.  Upon receiving the invitation you were excited about all of the possibilities this invitation could hold, perhaps holding a place on the vampiric council yourself?  The council emerges and performs a dramatic dance before lining up in a crescent shape before you.
